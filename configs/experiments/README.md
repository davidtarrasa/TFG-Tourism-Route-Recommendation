# Experiments / Baselines

This folder stores *snapshots* of the recommender configuration used in experiments.

Why:
- Keep `configs/recommender.toml` as the current "active" configuration.
- Preserve known-good parameter sets so we can reproduce results later.

Files:
- `recommender_baseline_2026-02-07.toml`: snapshot of the config before running full tuning.
